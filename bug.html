I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct configuration and import statements, but some classes were simply being ignored. This wasn't consistent across all classes, making it harder to debug. I tried various solutions, including purging unused styles, but nothing resolved the issue. The problem seemed to be tied to specific classes or certain combinations of classes.
