The issue was caused by a naming conflict with a custom CSS rule that had higher specificity than the Tailwind classes. By adjusting the custom CSS selector to have a lower specificity or updating the Tailwind class, the conflict was resolved and all the classes applied correctly.  Ensure your custom CSS rules don't unintentionally override Tailwind classes.
